            <h1>Woo Bo Le</h1>
            <p>He's a very smart person, but he often swears. However, that didn't stop us from becoming close friends. We're friends and enemies in learning. We usually share useful study tips and compare our exam results to see who is better. Besides that, we also share the same interests, like playing video games and listening to music.</p>

            <h1>Lau Tze Teng</h1>
            <p>He was the only Chinese boy in the class besides me, and we shared a classroom for three years. He was a very friendly person compared to Bo Le, although he sometimes did things I couldn't understand. He was also a helpful person, sometimes helping me solve problems, whether academic or daily questions.</p>

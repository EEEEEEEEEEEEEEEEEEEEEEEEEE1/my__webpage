        I got Kreatif class when I was in form 1, if I don't remember things incorrectly, my score at primary school isn't that bad, but I don't know why I got the last class. After that, my mother said that there have a test to Amanah class. After I had the test, I worried that I can't get into Amanah class becasue I can't answer some questions in English since I use Chinese words to answer most of the exam in my primary school. But after a few weeks, I got qualified to learn in Amanah class. 
        <br><br>
        I really like this school because there is a subject that I am into, which is Asas Sains Komputer. By the way, some of the coding skill for this webpage is learnt from that subject. Not only that, but I can also learn mathematics and science in English, which would be better when collage or university because they need English a lot.
        <br><br>
        Now I choose continue staying in Amanah class and not go to Bestari class that has Sains Komputer because Sains Komputer is only in Malay, and as I just mentioned, English is very important after secondary school.

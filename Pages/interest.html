    <ul>

            <h2><li>Playing Video Games</li></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 120%;">I enjoy playing single-player games and story-based games. I can release my stress from my daily life by watching a story in the game or exploring the game.
            Unlike a movie on television, I have the choice to change the outcome, whether it is good or bad, which allows me to become more immersed in the story. 
            I can get some profound knowledge, topics, and questions. For example, Why does life fall asleep and what is the first cause of life?</p>


            <h2><li>Listen To Music</li></h2>

            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 120%;">I became addicted to music!!! (I was still on the same playlist while coding).</p>
